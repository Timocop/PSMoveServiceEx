# PSMoveServiceEx
This fork has been created to expand the PSMoveSerivce lifespan with fixes, optimizations and new features.
Please use the original PSMoveService Wiki for now until i added my own.

# PSMoveService
A background service that manages multiple PSMove Controllers and PS3 Eye Cameras. Clients connect to the service and stream PSMove Controller state (position, orientation and button presses). A visual client front-end is used for controller/tracker configuration. The [FAQ](https://github.com/psmoveservice/PSMoveService/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) is a good starting point for any specific questions you may have about the project.
